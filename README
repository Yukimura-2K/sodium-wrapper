This is a set of C++11 wrappers to the libsodium library.

!!! EXPERIMENTAL AND INCOMPLETE -- VERY EARLY ALPHA -- DON'T USE YET !!!

>>> Interfaces are incomplete and subject to change <<<

I'm still figuring out how to best map libsodium's C-API to C++
classes. Therefore, the following C++ API is subject to change
at any time. Don't use yet for production code or anything serious.
This is an (self-)educational repo/project for now.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

Criticism and pull requests welcome, of course.

Dependencies:
  - libsodium 1.0.12
  - Boost 1.63.0+
      * Boost.Test for unit testing
      * Boost.Iostreams for streaming APIs.

Build dependencies:
  - a C++11 compliant compiler
  - CMake

I'm developing on:

  (primary development platform)
  - FreeBSD/amd64 11.0-STABLE
    clang++ 3.9.1 / llvm 3.9.1
      OR
    g++ 4.9.4
      OR
    g++ 6.3.0
    cmake version 3.7.2

  (secondary development platform)
  - Linux Mint Sarah 18.0
    clang++ 3.8.0 / llvm 3.8.0
      OR
